      <h2>Yin Yuzhen: Transforming Deserts into Forests in China</h2>
      <p>In the semi-arid region of Uxin Banner, Inner Mongolia, Yin Yuzhen began her battle against desertification in 1985.  Starting with planting trees in her backyard, she experimented with various plants to combat soil erosion and improve the barren landscape.  Over the years, her efforts expanded, attracting attention and support from local authorities and the community.  Her reforestation project, which started as a personal initiative, eventually gained significant recognition and state support, leading to substantial environmental improvements in the area.  </p>

      <p>Initiated in 2008 near Durban, the Buffelsdraai Landfill Site Community Reforestation Project aimed to offset carbon emissions from the 2010 FIFA World Cup by planting over 500,000 indigenous trees.  The project restored biodiversity, created jobs for local communities, and enhanced the capacity of people and ecosystems to adapt to climate change.  By 2023, over 1 million trees had been planted, and the project was recognized as one of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 'Founding 50' projects.  </p>

      <h2>Rwanda's Plastic Bag Ban</h2>
      <p>In 2008, Rwanda implemented a complete ban on single-use plastic bags, becoming one of the first countries to do so.  The law covered the production, importation, sale, and use of these plastics.  The ban was expanded in 2019 to include other single-use plastics like bottles, straws, plates, and forks.  The government's commitment, public awareness campaigns, and community involvement led to a significant reduction in plastic waste and contributed to a cleaner environment.

      <p>During the 2019 California International Marathon, Kristina Smithe was struck by the vast waste created by disposable cupsâ€”roughly 150,000 used by 9,000 runners across 17 aid stations.  Motivated to find a more sustainable solution, she designed a reusable, pliable silicone cup and launched her company, Hiccup Earth, in 2021.  Smithe now rents out 70,000 reusable cups to race events, collecting, washing, and reusing them to dramatically reduce event-related waste.  Since launching, sheâ€™s supplied 137 races and prevented an estimated 902,000 disposable cups from ending up in landfills.  </p>
